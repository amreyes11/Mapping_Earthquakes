# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview 

The purpose of this project is to provide Basil and Sadhana earthquake data as it relates to the location of tectonic plates on the earth and specifically, would like to see a map of earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.  

Deliverable 1:  Map of Tectonic Plates around the world

Summary:

Interactive map:  http://127.0.0.1:5500/

As you toggle through the options on the top right hand corner, you can choose to show data based off of topography maps and 3 options of data types:  tectonic plates, eartherquakes and major earthquakes.
